# Python AdWords App Engine Demo

Google's AdWords API lets developers design computer programs that
interact directly with the AdWords platform. With these applications,
advertisers and third parties can more efficiently—and creatively—manage
their large or complex AdWords accounts and campaigns.

App Engine offers a complete development stack that uses familiar technologies
to build and host web applications.

In order for the web application to communicate with AdWords API, we will use
the [Google Ads Python Client Library](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-legacy-lib).

In this demo, a user signs in and provides their MCC Client Customer Id and
other credentials that are used to access the AdWords API and provide the
following functionality:

* Retrieve and list client accounts.
* Retrieve and list the Campaigns for a given client account.
* Add new campaigns to a given client account.
* Retrieve and list the AdGroups for a given Campaign.
* Add new AdGroups to a given Campaign.
* Modify the Budget for a given campaign.

SOAP requests can take some time to complete - longer than Google App Engine
will allow. For production-grade web applications, we recommend using the
Task Queue API to handle requests asynchronously. You can read more about this
[here](https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/taskqueue/).


## Step-by-step guide for using AdWords API demo on App Engine:

This guide assumes that you have already set up your AdWords account
and have retrieved your OAuth2 credentials.

1. Install Python v2.7, which you can get
   [here](https://www.python.org/downloads).

2. Install [pip](http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installing.html),
   if you have not done so already.

3. If you don't have one already,
   [sign up for a Google Account](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount).
   This account will be used to access your AdWords credentials used in making
   API requests.

4. Download the latest version of the
   [App Engine SDK](https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads) and
   unpack its content. This demo should be compatible with  v1.9.11+.

5. Install fpconst with the following command:

   `$ pip install fpconst`

   Then copy the fpconst.py module from your Python installation's
   dist-packages directory into this project.

6. If you would rather use PyXML over ElementTree, install it with the following
   command:

   `$ pip install pyxml --allow-external pyxml --allow-unverified pyxml`

   Then copy the _xmlplus package from your Python installation's dist-packages
   directory into this project.

7. Install httplib2 with the following command:

   `$ pip install httplib2`

   Then copy the httplib2 package from your Python installation's dist-packages
   directory into this project.

8. Install oauth2client with the following command:

   `$ pip install oauth2client`

   Then copy the oauth2client package from your Python installation's
   dist-packages directory into this project.

9. Install the Google Ads Client Libraries with the following command:

   `$ pip install adspygoogle`

   Then copy the adspygoogle package from your Python installation's
   dist-packages directory into this project.

10. Create an application in the
   [Google App Engine Console](https://appengine.google.com/).

11. Go to this project's app.yaml, and enter in your application name for the
   "application" field.

12. You can now deploy this project by running the following command:

    `python $APPENGINE_SDK_DIR/appcfg --oauth2 update .`

13. When you go to your App for the first time, you will need to log in and
    provide OAuth2 and AdWords API credentials. You can use credentials
    generated by the authorize_without_pickle.py example.

14. With all information entered, you can now view details requiring requests
     against the AdWords API.
